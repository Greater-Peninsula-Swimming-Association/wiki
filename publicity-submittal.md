## Quick Reference

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Download the Results File

After the meet concludes, export the SDIF/SD3 results file from SwimTopia:

1. Log in to SwimTopia as a meet administrator
2. Navigate to **Meets** > **Meet Results**
3. Select the meet you want to export
4. Click **Export Results**
5. Choose **SDIF/SD3 Format** (not HY3 format)
6. Save the file (e.g., `meet_results.sd3`)

The file will have an `.sd3` or `.txt` extension.

**Important:** The tool does NOT support HY3/Hy-Tek 3.0 format files. Always export as SDIF/SD3.

#### Troubleshooting Export Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't find Export Results option | Verify you have meet administrator access in SwimTopia |
| File won't download | Check browser download settings and try a different browser |
| Only HY3 format available | Contact SwimTopia support - SDIF export should be available for all meets |

### 2. Email the Results

Send the SDIF/SD3 file as an attachment to:

**[publicity@gpsaswimming.org](mailto:publicity@gpsaswimming.org)**

Include in your email:
- Teams involved (e.g., "Glendale vs Wendwood")
- Meet date

### 3. Automatic Processing

An automation agent monitors the publicity inbox and processes submitted results. The league results page will be updated automatically with your meet results.
