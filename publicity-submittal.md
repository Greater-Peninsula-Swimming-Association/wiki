## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Download the Results File

After the meet concludes, export the SDIF/SD3 results file from SwimTopia:

1. Log in to Meet Maestro as a meet administrator
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Finish & Export** > **Downloads**
3. Export Type: **Results**
4. Export Format: **SDIF SD3**
5. Team: **All Times**
6. Click **Generate File**
7. Once available **Download** Results file

The file will have an `.zip` extension.

**Important:** The tool does NOT support HY3/Hy-Tek 3.0 format files. Always export as SDIF/SD3.

#### Troubleshooting Export Issues

| Problem | Solution |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Can't find Export Results option | Verify you have meet administrator access in SwimTopia |
| File won't download | Check browser download settings and try a different browser |
| Only HY3 format available | Contact SwimTopia support - SDIF export should be available for all meets |

### 2. Email the Results

Send the Zip/SDIF/SD3 file as an attachment to:

**[publicity@gpsaswimming.org](mailto:publicity@gpsaswimming.org)**

Include in your email:

- Teams involved (e.g., "Glendale vs Wendwood")
- Meet date

### 3. Automatic Processing

An automation agent monitors the publicity inbox and processes submitted results. The league results page will be updated automatically with your meet results.
