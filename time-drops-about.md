The **Time Drops Wireless Swim Timing System** is used by over half of the teams in GPSA for electronic timing at swim meets. This system uses wireless keyfob-style timer buttons instead of traditional wired plunger systems.

## What is Time Drops?

Time Drops is a **wireless electronic timing system** consisting of dedicated hardware components:

- **Wireless timer buttons (PB-2)** - Keyfob-style devices that timers press when swimmers touch the wall
  ![Time Drops Buttons](assets/time-drops/time-drops-buttons-01.png)
- **Timing controller (STC-1)** - The "heart" of the system with a precision reference clock
  ![Time Drops Controller](assets/time-drops/time-drops-controller-stc001.jpg)
- **Start adapter (SA-1)** - Wirelessly receives signals from starting systems
  ![Time Drops Start Adapter](assets/time-drops/time-drops-starter-02.png)
- **Android tablet** - Runs the Time Drops Console app to manage the system
- **Windows laptop** - Runs MM-Link software to bridge to meet management software (Hy-Tek Meet Manager or SwimTopia Meet Maestro)

### How It Works

1. Timers at the end of each lane hold wireless button devices on lanyards
2. When a swimmer touches the wall, timers press their buttons
3. Button presses are transmitted wirelessly to the STC-1 controller
4. The controller's precision clock timestamps each button press
5. Times are sent via Wi-Fi to the Android tablet
6. The tablet evaluates results and sends data to the Windows laptop
7. MM-Link software exports results to meet management software

## FAQ

### Is Time Drops required for GPSA teams?

No. Teams may use any timing system (or manual timing) that meets GPSA meet requirements and integrates with Meet Maestro.

### What happens if buttons fall in the pool?

The PB-2 buttons are IP67 water resistant and will continue to function after pool submersion. However, retrieve them quickly to minimize water exposure. Dry thoroughly before storage.

### How long do button batteries last?

CR2032 batteries last 500+ hours of continuous operation, typically 2-3 years of recreational swim team use. Replace batteries at the start of every other swim season as preventive maintenance.

### Can we use Time Drops without internet?

Wi-Fi is required for communication between controller, tablet, and laptop. Internet connection is recommended but not strictly required for basic timing. However, Time Drops Live! requires internet for spectator access.

### What if our Wi-Fi fails during a meet?

Immediately switch to manual backup timing per GPSA rules. This is why manual stopwatches and lane timer sheets are required as backup.

### Can Time Drops handle championship meets?

Yes. Time Drops is designed for meets of any size. Teams can pool buttons from multiple systems to configure for more lanes. See "Pooling Equipment" section.

### How do results get exported to SDIF?

Meet management software (Meet Maestro) creates SDIF export files. These can then be processed through the GPSA Publicity Processor to generate formatted HTML results.

### Do timers need to watch the tablet screen?

No. Timers should focus on watching their assigned swimmer. When the swimmer touches the wall, press the button. The tablet automatically evaluates times and doesn't require timer monitoring.
