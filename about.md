The Greater Peninsula Swimming Association (GPSA) is a summer recreational swim league serving youth swimmers on the Virginia Peninsula. Founded in the 1960s, GPSA has provided generations of swimmers with a fun, competitive environment to develop their skills and build lasting friendships.

## Mission Statement

Our mission is to:

- Provide a safe, fun, and competitive swimming environment
- Develop swimming skills and sportsmanship in young athletes
- Foster community connections through team spirit
- Create positive summer experiences for families

## League Structure

### Divisions

GPSA is organized into three divisions based on team size and competitive balance:

- **Red Division**
- **White Division**
- **Blue Division**

For current team assignments, see the [Meet Schedule](https://www.gpsaswimming.org/meet-schedule) on the GPSA website.

#### How Divisions Work

- Teams are assigned to divisions before each season based on competitive balance
- Division assignments may change year-to-year as team sizes and competitiveness shift
- Each division has a **Division Coordinator** who helps manage scheduling and communication
- Teams compete primarily against other teams in their division during dual meets

#### Division Scheduling

- Each team swims **one dual meet per week** during the regular season (typically Monday or Thursday evenings)
- The schedule rotates so teams face different opponents each week
- Home and away designations alternate throughout the season
- Division schedules are published before the season on the [Meet Schedule](https://www.gpsaswimming.org/meet-schedule) page

### Season Format

The GPSA season runs from mid-June through mid-July, featuring:

#### Dual Meets

Standard head-to-head competitions between two teams from the same division. These count toward division standings and are the primary format for regular season competition.

#### Friendship Meets

Optional meets between teams from **different divisions** or teams wanting additional competition. Friendship meets:

- Do **not** count toward division standings or rankings
- Follow the same rules and format as dual meets
- Are scheduled by mutual agreement between participating teams
- Provide additional competition opportunities without affecting standings

#### Championship Events

- **[Summer Splash Invitational](https://invitationals.gpsaswimming.org)** - Season-ending awards meet celebrating participation
- **[Championship Meet (City Meet)](https://invitationals.gpsaswimming.org)** - Season-ending championship for qualifying swimmers
