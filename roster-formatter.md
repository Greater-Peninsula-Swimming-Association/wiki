## Tab 1: Roster Input

### Getting the CSV File

#### Exporting from SwimTopia

1. Log in to your SwimTopia team admin account
2. Navigate to **Roster** > **Team Roster**
3. Click **Export** and select **CSV format**
4. Save the file (e.g., `glendale-2025-roster.csv`)

#### Required CSV Columns

The CSV must contain these columns:

| Column Name | Description | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| `AgeGroup` | Age group (may include gender prefix) | `9-10`, `Boys 11-12` |
| `AthleteCompetitionCategory` | Gender code | `M` or `F` |
| `AthleteDisplayName` | Swimmer's full name | `Smith, John` |
| `AthleteAge` | Numeric age | `10` |

**Note:** Gender prefixes in age groups (e.g., "Boys 9-10") are automatically stripped by the tool.

### Processing the Roster

1. Click **Choose File** or drag-and-drop your CSV
2. Wait for "CSV file loaded successfully!" toast notification (green)
3. Navigate to **Formatted Roster** tab to see preview
4. Click **Export Roster HTML** when ready

### Age Group Handling

The tool processes age groups as follows:

- **Strips Gender Prefixes**: "Boys 9-10" → "9-10"
- **Sorts Age Groups**: 8 & Under, 9-10, 11-12, 13-14, 15-18, Open
- **Sorts Swimmers**: Alphabetically by name within each age group

## Tab 2: Contacts

### Adding Contact Information

Contacts are team representatives, coordinators, or key personnel. To add a contact:

1. Click **Add Contact** button
2. Enter contact details in the form fields:
   - **Name** (required)
   - **Role/Title** (e.g., "Team Representative", "Head Coach")
   - **Email** (validated in real-time)
   - **Phone** (auto-formatted to (XXX) XXX-XXXX)

### Email Validation

- Email fields show **red border** if invalid (missing @, no domain, etc.)
- Email fields show **green border** when valid
- Export is blocked if any invalid emails are detected

### Phone Formatting

Phone numbers are automatically formatted as `(XXX) XXX-XXXX`:

- Input: `7575551234`
- Output: `(757) 555-1234`

### Duplicate Detection

The tool warns you (orange toast) if you enter a contact name that already exists, but doesn't prevent saving.

### Data Persistence

- Contacts **auto-save to browser localStorage** on every change
- Data persists across browser sessions and restarts
- Use **Clear Contacts** button to reset (removes both UI and localStorage)

### Removing Contacts

Click the **red trash icon** (🗑️) next to any contact to remove it. The removal is immediate and updates localStorage.

## Tab 3: Officials

### Adding Officials Information

Officials are certified volunteers who work meets. To add an official:

1. Click **Add Official** button
2. Enter official details:
   - **Name** (required)
   - **Certification Level** (e.g., "Stroke & Turn", "Starter", "Referee")
   - **Email** (validated in real-time)
   - **Phone** (auto-formatted)

### Certification Levels

Common GPSA official certification levels:

- **Stroke & Turn Judge**
- **Starter**
- **Referee**
- **Administrative Official**
- **Chief Judge**

### Data Persistence

Like contacts, officials also:

- Auto-save to localStorage
- Persist across browser sessions
- Can be cleared with **Clear Officials** button

## Tab 4: Formatted Roster

### Preview and Export

The **Formatted Roster** tab shows a live preview of all three outputs:

1. **Team Roster** - Swimmers organized by age group
2. **Contact Information** - Table of contacts with roles and info
3. **Officials** - List of officials with certifications

### Export Options

Three export buttons are available:

1. **Export Roster HTML** - Copies roster HTML to clipboard
2. **Export Contacts HTML** - Copies contacts table HTML to clipboard
3. **Export Officials HTML** - Copies officials list HTML to clipboard

Each export:

- Copies HTML to your clipboard via modern Clipboard API
- Shows green success toast notification
- Can be pasted directly into SwimTopia HTML editor

### Export Format

Exports are **HTML-only** (no embedded CSS) and reference external stylesheets:

- **Roster**: `/css/gpsa-roster.css`
- **Contacts**: `/css/gpsa-roster-contact.css`
- **Officials**: `/css/gpsa-roster-officials.css`

These stylesheets are hosted on `publicity.gpsaswimming.org` and automatically apply when the HTML is published on SwimTopia.

## Using the Formatted HTML

### Pasting into SwimTopia CMS

1. Click the appropriate **Export** button in the tool
2. Log in to your SwimTopia team admin account
3. Navigate to the page you want to update (e.g., "Team Roster" page)
4. Click **Edit** on the page
5. Switch to **HTML/Source** mode (usually a `<>` button)
6. **Select all existing content** and delete (or paste over it)
7. **Paste** the HTML from your clipboard (`Ctrl+V` or `Cmd+V`)
8. Switch back to visual mode to preview
9. Click **Save** and **Publish**

### Updating Existing Rosters

When the season changes or roster updates are needed:

1. Export fresh CSV from SwimTopia
2. Upload to Roster Formatter tool (replaces old data)
3. Contacts and officials **persist automatically** from localStorage
4. Verify contact info is still current
5. Export and publish updated HTML

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing required columns" Error

**Cause:** CSV doesn't have required `AgeGroup`, `AthleteCompetitionCategory`, `AthleteDisplayName`, or `AthleteAge` columns.

**Solution:**

- Re-export from SwimTopia using **Team Roster** export
- Verify you're exporting the roster, not meet results or entries

### "Please fix invalid email addresses before exporting" Error

**Cause:** One or more email fields have invalid format.

**Solution:**

- Look for email fields with **red borders**
- Correct the email format (must include `@` and domain)
- Email validation updates on blur (when you click away from field)

### Contacts/Officials Disappeared

**Cause:** Browser localStorage was cleared or you're using a different browser/device.

**Solution:**

- Re-enter contacts and officials (they'll auto-save)
- Consider keeping a backup document with contact info
- Use same browser/device for consistency

### Phone Numbers Not Formatting

**Cause:** Phone formatting only applies to 10-digit US phone numbers.

**Solution:**

- Enter exactly 10 digits (no spaces, dashes, or parentheses)
- Formatting applies when you click away from field (on blur)
- For non-US numbers, enter with desired formatting

### Export Button Does Nothing

**Cause:** Browser may not support modern Clipboard API or permission denied.

**Solution:**

- Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Ensure you've granted clipboard permissions if prompted
- Try refreshing the page and re-uploading data

### Roster Preview Looks Unstyled

**Cause:** External CSS files may not be loading in preview.

**Solution:**

- Preview is for content verification only
- Final styling will apply when published on SwimTopia
- Trust that the CSS is hosted and will load on production site

## Data Persistence Details

### What Gets Saved

The tool saves to browser localStorage:

- **Contacts** - Stored as `gpsa_roster_contacts`
- **Officials** - Stored as `gpsa_roster_officials`
- **Roster Data** - NOT saved (must re-upload CSV each time)

### When Data is Saved

- Auto-saves on every input field change (on blur)
- Saves when adding/removing contacts or officials
- No manual "Save" button needed

### Clearing Saved Data

1. Use **Clear Contacts** button to remove all contacts
2. Use **Clear Officials** button to remove all officials
3. Or use **Reset All** to clear everything at once

**Note:** Clearing also removes data from localStorage.

### localStorage Limits

- Browser localStorage limit: ~5-10 MB per domain
- This is more than sufficient for typical team contacts/officials
- If limit reached, browser will show an error (extremely rare)

## Best Practices

### For Team Reps

1. **Export CSV at season start** - Get complete roster from SwimTopia
2. **Enter contacts/officials once** - They persist automatically
3. **Update mid-season** - Re-upload CSV if swimmers join/leave
4. **Verify emails before export** - Check for red borders
5. **Test in preview** - Review formatted output before publishing
6. **Keep backup** - Document contacts/officials outside the tool

### For Webmasters

1. **Use consistent formatting** - Same tool for all teams
2. **Update external CSS** - Ensure stylesheets on publicity.gpsaswimming.org are current
3. **Test on mobile** - Verify responsive display on phones/tablets
4. **Archive old rosters** - Save HTML for historical reference

### For Data Entry

1. **Copy/paste carefully** - When entering multiple contacts
2. **Use Tab key** - Navigate between fields efficiently
3. **Verify phone format** - Ensure 10 digits for auto-formatting
4. **Check for duplicates** - Watch for orange warning toasts
5. **Save as you go** - Data auto-saves, but verify before closing

## Security Features

### XSS Protection

All user input is sanitized using the `escapeHtml()` function to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This means:

- Special characters are escaped in output
- HTML tags in input are rendered as text, not executed
- Scripts cannot be injected via contact names or emails

### Safe HTML Output

The generated HTML is safe to paste into SwimTopia CMS without security concerns:

- No inline JavaScript
- No event handlers
- Only semantic HTML structure with CSS classes
