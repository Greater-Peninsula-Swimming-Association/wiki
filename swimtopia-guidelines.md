## People

Managing your team roster is the foundation of using SwimTopia effectively.

**Official Documentation:** [Managing Your People/Roster – SwimTopia Help Center](https://help.swimtopia.com/hc/en-us/articles/200783338-Managing-Your-People-Roster#h_911c3a87-d13c-4ed8-ba8e-ab64cc971edd)

### Swimmer / Parent Account Deletion

If a swimmer leaves your pool, you will need to email <help@swimtopia.com> asking they remove the team association with the necessary email accounts.

**Note:** SwimTopia support must handle account deletions - team administrators cannot remove associations directly.

## Roles

Roles allow you to organize people into groups for efficient communication and manage access within the Manage Team area. Any parent or athlete on your team can be assigned to a role for grouping purposes, from assigning meet jobs to sending group emails.

**Official Documentation:** [Defining Roles](https://help.swimtopia.com/hc/en-us/articles/200783278-Defining-Roles)

### League Shared Roles

Some roles are created and shared from the League level. This allows league administrators to send targeted communications to each group if required. While the name of these roles cannot be changed, the other attributes can be modified locally in your team site.

![Individual Entry](assets/swimtopia/image13.png)

Bulk entries can be completed by clicking **Edit Entries** in the upper right hand corner.

![Bulk Entry](assets/swimtopia/image39.png)

### Declare Exhibition Swimmers

To aid in the automatic seeding and scoring of the meet using Meet Maestro, exhibition swimmers must be declared during the entry selection process. This is accomplished using the **Exh** checkbox during swimmer entry selection as demonstrated below.

**Official Documentation:**
- [Exhibition Events/Athletes](https://help.swimtopia.com/hc/en-us/articles/211075983-Exhibition-Events-Athletes#h_01G66B6EY9PCKWM29NDX1S30YH)
- [If performed in Meet Maestro on deck](https://help.swimtopia.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010479811#h_01G667F30TV86TT8YMJE78FSB5)

![Exhibition Checkbox](assets/swimtopia/image7.png)

![Exhibition Entry Example](assets/swimtopia/image5.png)

### Swimming a Swimmer "Up"

When in the detailed view of a swimmer, selecting the **All** URL in the bottom right will show all events the swimmer is eligible to swim-up in.

![Swim Up Option](assets/swimtopia/image8.png)

### Bonus Entry for Small Teams

To keep all teams using the same meet template, any team that meets the requirements to allow swimmers to swim in 4 individual events can do so by using the **Bon** checkbox. It is the responsibility of the GPSA rep and coach to ensure bonus entries are only used when permitted by GPSA rules.

### Building a Relay Team

Relay teams can be edited to add/remove swimmers (and specify swim-up ages), change the relay order, rearrange swimmers within the relay, enter custom seed times, and to mark a relay as an exhibition entry if necessary.

**Official Documentation:** [Edit Relay Teams](https://help.swimtopia.com/hc/en-us/articles/201748126-Automatic-Relay-Generation-and-Settings#h_01G37FJVMHDK6KCEEKSFGVMKVY)

![Relay Team Builder](assets/swimtopia/image19.png)

### Entries Matrix

The Entries Matrix uses the below indicators and colors to indicate the status of a swimmer.

#### Color Indicators

- **Light green** - Declared to be attending but not necessarily entered in specific events
- **Dark green** - Athlete is entered into that event
- **Grey** - Not eligible (not attending, not qualified, arriving late, or leaving early)
- **Orange** - Entered but not qualified

#### Other Indicators

- **"X"** - Exhibition Swim
- **"A"** - Alternate
- **"B"** - Bonus (doesn't count against entry limits)

![Entries Matrix](assets/swimtopia/image37.png)

### Entry Reports

#### Meet Entries by Athlete

![Entries by Athlete Report](assets/swimtopia/image18.png)

This report is helpful to validate the number of entries per swimmer. Age-up swimmers are identified by highlighting.

#### Meet Entries by Event

![Entries by Event Report](assets/swimtopia/image32.png)

This report is helpful to ensure every event has the proper number of point swimmers. Age-up swimmers are identified by highlighting.

## Running the Meet

### Keeping the Score Blind

Per GPSA rules, meet scores must remain hidden until all events are complete.

Once a meet has been merged, a link to Meet Maestro will appear on the upper right portion of the screen. Click the **Meet Maestro** button to access the Meet.

![Launch Meet Maestro](assets/swimtopia/image36.png)

Once in Meet Maestro, click on the **Settings Gear** on the upper right portion of the screen.

![Meet Maestro Settings](assets/swimtopia/image30.png)

Once in the Settings menu, click on the **Mobile App** subheader on the far left. In the middle of the screen, there will be sliding options (**Score Display**) to turn Combined/Men/Women scoring off. This will prevent any scoring from displaying on the mobile app.

![Score Display Settings](assets/swimtopia/image24.png)

### Manual Timing System

Manual timing is equivalent to using stopwatches (battery operated, digital read-out) to record the duration of the individual swim.

**Starting the Watch:**
- Start at the instant of observing the visual starting signal
- If the visual starting signal is not observed, start upon hearing the starting signal

**Stopping the Watch:**
- Stop when any part of the swimmer touches the wall at the completion of the distance of the event
- Record times to the hundredths place (two decimals) with no rounding

**Timer Requirements:**
- **One timer:** Recorded time is the official time
- **Two timers:** Average the recorded times to determine the official time
- **Three timers:** Use the intermediate (middle) time as the official time

### Semi-Automatic Timing System

A Semi-Automatic Timing System begins automatically with an electronic signal from the starting unit and ends manually when the timer pushes their button at the finish of the race.

**Process:**
- System starts automatically with electronic starting signal
- Timer presses button when any part of the swimmer touches the wall
- Times are automatically transmitted to a central system integrated with Meet Maestro

**Timer Requirements:**
- **One timer:** Recorded time is the official time
- **Two timers:** Average the recorded times to determine the official time
- **Three timers:** Use the intermediate (middle) time as the official time

## Official Roles

### Meet Ref Role

The Meet Referee is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the meet and ensuring compliance with swimming rules.

**Official Rules:** [USA Swimming Rulebook - Article 102.11](https://www.usaswimming.org/docs/default-source/rules-regulations/2023-rulebook.pdf)

- [USA Swimming Rulebook - Article 102.13](https://www.usaswimming.org/docs/default-source/rules-regulations/2023-rulebook.pdf)

**Additional Training:** [Officials Training Materials](https://www.teamunify.com/team/va/page/officials/official-training)

### Sweep Judge Role

Sweep Judges determine the official order of finish for each heat.

**Official Rules:** [USA Swimming Rulebook - Article 102.13.2](https://www.usaswimming.org/docs/default-source/rules-regulations/2023-rulebook.pdf)

Each team will provide a Sweep Judge and each will independently record the Order of Finish across the 4 scoring lanes.

**Form:** [Sweep Judge Order of Finish Form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qF-M9VYFpAfvxB6xZ2-HMnbI2uz9_fGK/view?usp=sharing)

**Dispute Resolution:** If judges do not agree on the order of finish, see [GPSA Rules - Article XV.A.6](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wh39Z_TIjtHMR5Rcxmbd5r3es-hDWB5f/view?pli=1). The Referee may settle the order of finish if personally observed or declare a tie.

### Runner Role

The Runner is responsible for collecting all lane slips from the timers and delivering them to the Sweep Judges for review. The Runner is also responsible for collecting DQ slips from Stroke and Turn Judges and delivering to the Meet Ref. After the Meet Ref has reviewed lane slips and DQ slips for a particular event, the Runner may be asked to deliver those artifacts to the Scoring Table for processing.

### Scorekeeper Role

Each team will provide a scorekeeper. The scorekeepers will perform two functions:

1. Record the official time collected by the timer on to the scoresheet or exhibition sheet
2. Record the placement for the 4 swimmers competing in scoring lanes

#### Using Meet Maestro as Scorekeeper

1. Select the appropriate meet from the Schedule

![Select Meet](assets/swimtopia/image3.png)

2. Click the **Meet Maestro** button to actively manage the meet

![Launch Meet Maestro](assets/swimtopia/image12.png)

3. Once in Meet Maestro, scorekeepers can navigate heat to heat, event to event, using the left and right arrows at the top-middle of the screen

4. **If using stopwatches and lane slips:**
   - Scorekeepers will receive a collection of lane slips for each event from the Meet Ref or the Runner
   - Match the lane slip to the entry in Meet Maestro (swimmer's name, team, heat, and lane should all match)
   - Record the time collected on the lane slip into the box labeled **Timer 1**
   - Denote the placement in the **Heat Place** column (points populate automatically)
   - Exhibition lanes should already be marked
   - If there is a DQ slip attached to the lane slip, mark the **DQ** column and select the code checked on the DQ slip

5. **If using Time Drops:**
   - Scorekeepers will click the **Load Times** button to retrieve the times recorded by Time Drops
   - The Meet Ref or Runner will drop off a card with the official order of finish
   - Record this in the **Heat Place** column (points populate automatically)
   - Exhibition lanes should already be marked
   - If there is a DQ slip attached, mark the **DQ** column and select the code checked on the DQ slip

![Meet Maestro Time Entry](assets/swimtopia/image22.png)

6. Once all entries have been completed, review the collection of events with the Meet Ref who will sign off on the meet

### Ribbon Writer / Labeler

Each team will provide a Ribbon Writer for the meet. Once the Scorekeepers have completed their time entries for a particular event, they will hand the associated lane slips to the Ribbon Writers to label the award ribbons accordingly. These can be written manually or labels can be generated from Meet Maestro.

#### Generating Award Labels

To generate labels, launch Meet Maestro for the active meet and click the **Settings Gear** on the top right of the screen.

![Settings Gear](assets/swimtopia/image28.png)

Once in the Settings, select the **Reports** tab on the left side of the screen.

![Reports Tab](assets/swimtopia/image34.png)

#### Heat Place Labels

Click on **Award Labels**. Configure settings:

- **Award Type:** Heat Place
- **Heats:** 1 of 1
- **Individual Places:** 1 to 4

This will generate Award Labels for Heat 1 placement only. Once the report is generated, click the **Printer** icon to send to the Printer.

**Label Stock:** Use Avery 8160 for inkjet printers or Avery 5160 for laser printers.

![Award Labels Settings](assets/swimtopia/image21.png)

#### Participation Labels

**Label Stock:** Use Avery 8160 for inkjet printers or Avery 5160 for laser printers.

![Participation Labels](assets/swimtopia/image38.png)

## Flow of an Event

This section describes the complete flow of a single event from start to finish:

1. **Call swimmers behind blocks**
   - The Meet Ref will issue a series of 4-5 short whistles, signaling the swimmers behind the block to get ready for the next heat

2. **Announce the event**
   - Announcer/Starter will announce the event/heat

3. **Step up to blocks**
   - Once the Meet Ref can see that the swimmers are behind the block and ready, the Meet Ref will blow 1 long whistle inviting the swimmers to step up on the block

4. **Hand off to Starter**
   - Once the swimmers are on the block, the Meet Ref will extend their arm, clearly visible to the Starter
   - This action hands the control of the heat to the Starter

5. **Start the race**
   - The Starter will invite the swimmers to 'Take Your Marks'
   - Once each swimmer has obtained a set position, the Starter will engage the starting unit, thus beginning the heat

6. **Record finish times**
   - As the swimmers approach the wall for the completion of the swim, the timers should position themselves such that they can clearly observe the swimmer touching the wall
   - At the moment the swimmer touches the wall, the timer should stop their watch or press the button on the Time Drops device
   - Record the time to the nearest hundredths

7. **Signal next heat**
   - The Meet Ref will issue a series of 4-5 short whistles, signaling the start of the next heat/event
   - This action will start this process over again for the subsequent heat/event

8. **Collect lane slips**
   - The Runner should collect all lane slips and deliver them to the Sweep Judges, who will collectively determine the 'Order of Finish' (if lane slips are used)

9. **Collect DQ slips**
   - If the Runner has any DQ slips collected from the Stroke and Turn Judges, they should be delivered to the Meet Ref for final adjudication

10. **Determine order of finish**
    - The Sweep Judges will hand over the 'ordered' lane slips or card with the Order of Finish to the Meet Ref
    - The Meet Ref will flag any lane slips with any accompanying DQ
    - This may change the order of finish depending on the disqualified participants (For example, if the second place swimmer is disqualified, the third and fourth place finishers will be promoted in the order of finish accordingly)

11. **Deliver to scorekeepers**
    - The Meet Ref, or Runner if directed by the Meet Ref, will deliver the ordered lane slips with accompanying DQ slips to the Scorekeepers for processing
    - If not using lane slips, order of finish cards/slips will be turned in

12. **Record results**
    - The Scorekeepers will record the times and placement (for scoring heats) on the scoresheet or directly in SwimTopia
    - DQs should be denoted as well
    - If the lane slips are for an exhibition swim, the times should be recorded on the exhibition sheet or denoted as exhibition within SwimTopia

13. **Process ribbons**
    - The Scorekeepers will hand the lane slips to the Ribbon Writers for processing

## Export Meet Results to Teams Repository

After the meet is complete and all results are entered:

1. In Meet Maestro, click on the **Settings** gear located on the top right of the screen
