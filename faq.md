## Swimming Rules

### How are age groups determined?

Age is determined as of June 1st of the current season. For example, if your child turns 11 on July 15th but was 10 on June 1st, they compete in the 9-10 age group.

### How many events can my child swim?

Each swimmer may compete in up to 3 individual events plus 1 relay per meet. Coaches manage event assignments to ensure fair participation.

### What are the four competitive strokes?

1. **Freestyle** - Any stroke, typically front crawl
2. **Backstroke** - Swimming on your back
3. **Breaststroke** - Simultaneous arm pull and frog kick
4. **Butterfly** - Simultaneous over-water arm recovery and dolphin kick

### What is an Individual Medley (IM)?

An IM is a race where the swimmer completes all four strokes in this order: butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle.

### What happens if a swimmer is disqualified (DQ)?

A DQ means the swimmer violated a stroke or turn rule, resulting in no points. While officials must notate the infraction, coaches can explain the specific violation and use it as a valuable teaching opportunity.

## Team & Practice

### Are practices required?

Practice policies vary by team. Check with your team representative or coach for specific attendance expectations.

### What if we have to miss a meet?

Communicate absences to your coach as early as possible so they can plan relay lineups and event assignments.
