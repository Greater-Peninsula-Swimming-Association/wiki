## Visiting Team Preparation Checklist

While the home team handles most materials, the visiting team should prepare:

### 1. Heat Sheets (Backup)

Generate at least 2-3 heat sheets for:

- Visiting scorekeeper
- Visiting team coach
- Visiting GPSA Representative

**Note:** The home team is responsible for providing official heat sheets, but having backups ensures your team has copies if needed.

### 2. Scorekeeper Setup (Recommended)

Bring a laptop or tablet with SwimTopia access for your scorekeeper to:

- Enter times in real-time
- Cross-check entries with home scorekeeper
- Have backup access if needed

See [SwimTopia Guidelines - Using Meet Maestro as Scorekeeper](swimtopia-guidelines.md#using-meet-maestro-as-scorekeeper).

### 3. Team Roster Print (Optional)

Print a current team roster for reference in case of last-minute substitutions or questions.
