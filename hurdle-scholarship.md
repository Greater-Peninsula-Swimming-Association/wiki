Kyle was a U.S. Naval Academy Midshipman in the class of 2004. He swam for the Academy for two years before his sudden and unexpected death in 2001.

Kyle was from Newport News and a 1999 graduate of Warwick High School. Before his time with the Midshipmen, Kyle swam for CGBD, FTE, WYCC, and Beaconsdale in GPSA.

Kyle was driven and determined to be a winner, both in the water and in life. He always did what was expected of him and led by way of example.

> "He had super integrity. What a great young man. I wish I had a hundred more like him."
