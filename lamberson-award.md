Kei grew up heavily involved in swimming, competing for SEVA, Typhoon Aquatics, CGBD, Marlbank Mudtoads, and York High. He became a coach for Marlbank for two summers before passing away in 2018 at 27 years old.

Kei approached life with an unbelievable amount of joy, compassion, and companionship. He strove every day to pursue living life to the fullest, connecting with those around him and letting nothing slow him down. He cared deeply about others, without expecting any reciprocation.

His enjoyment in connecting with others was exemplified in his approach towards coaching, where he made a point to connect with each swimmer, enabling and supporting each swimmer to find their passion in the sport. His ability to bring out the best in each individual led swimmers to look up to him and parents to appreciate his team leadership.

The Kei Lamberson Award goes to the coach that best exemplifies these qualities, displaying their passion for the sport and connecting with each swimmer.
